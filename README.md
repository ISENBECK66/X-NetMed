### The importance of a precox diagnosis in pneumonia disease :

####
Pneumonia is inflammation and fluid in your lungs caused by a bacterial, viral or fungal infection. It makes it difficult to breathe and can cause a fever and cough with yellow, green or bloody mucus. The flu, COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease are common causes of pneumonia. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of pneumonia.
Not surprisingly many consider that chest radiology, which is a relatively inexpensive test, plays a fundamental and important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia, together with clinical assessment and sometimes appropriate microbiological testing. Its primary purpose is to diagnose or exclude pneumonia.
Certainly, in the case of patients admitted to hospital there is evidence that the early performance of a chest radiograph is associated with clinical benefit, including a significantly shorter hospital length of stay and antibiotic use after radiologyIt is possible for doctors to understand the presence of Pneumonia.

### Neural Network and Deep Learning to build a binary classifier to elaborate x-ray images :
####
The target of this project is to automatically verify the presence of a a pneumonia infection throught the analisys of the x-ray images of the patient's chest.
We used a Neural Network and a pretrained model that it is been adapted for our scopes.
The choosen pre-trained model it has been *ResNet50* from *keras* package.
The initial weights for the preprocess of the images has come from *imagenet*.
####

### Dataset :
####
The *dataset* that is been used for train our model come from *Keggle* and contains almost 6000 x-ray images splitted in *NORMAL* and *PNEUMONIA* classes:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia]
####

### Software architecture :
We decided to split the service in two separated function :
#### *Model* : 
This function needs a lot of GPU resources and its task consist into apply the model on the data provided and send back the results.
#### *Gatewey* :
This function get the input data from the user interface and pre-elaborate the image.
After this elaboration the service send the image to the *Model-service* to receive the evaluation.
Once the function have the evaluation back from the *Model* service, it adjust the data and provide to a post-elaboration before to give data back to the user.

### Repository content:
#### - notebook.ipynb file
This repository contains *notebook.ipynb file* : In this file we load the *ResNet50* model and the *dataset* downloaded from kaggle.
We worked on the *model* building on its top our specific *dense layer / inner layer* trained on the images loaded from our *dataset*.     
In the same file we tried different setup to obtain the best performance, tuning model parameters, as : *leraning_rate*, *drop_rate* and *augmentation*.
#### - ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5 file
We used the *keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint()* function to export the most performing model into the file: *ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5*.
#### - chest_xray-model folder
This is our final model format, we obtain it as output of method *tf_saved_model.save()*, applied to our *ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5* ; in this format we can use it from *tensorflow/serving*.
#### - image-model-dockerfile
This is the *docker* that we buil to apply the model.
We decided to have two separated services, one specialized in model application *model*, and another one that collect the requests from the client and provide to data elaboration pre and post evaluation *gateway*.
#### - tf-serving-connect.ipynb
Through this notebook we implemented the *gateway* service that provide image's pre-elaboration and send it to *image-model-dockerfile* that it is running to evaluate the x-ray chest images submitted.
#### - gateway.py
this is the convertion of the notebook *tf-serving-connect.ipynb* in a python script.
#### - Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
These files specify the dependencies that *gateway.py* script needs to install running in a virtual environment.
#### - proto.py
In this file we included the method *np_to_protobuf()*, this is the only method thatvwe need from *tensorflow* library.
In this way we can avoid to include in the project the huge *tensorflow* library (1.7Gb).
#### - image-gateway.dockerfile
This is the file to build the *docker* for the *gateway service*. We use this *dockerfile* to specify its parameters.
#### - test.py
This script provide the access at the diagnostic service, it loads the image url from the *user_terminal* and send it to the *gateway-service* receving back the image evaluation.
#### - docker-compose.yaml
This configuration file it is used to put the two docker in the same network and test the services using the *docker-compose* function.

### Running the project :

#### Get a copy of project and dependencies, or clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.co******************/
```
Terminal_1

#### Run the Docker for the *model* service :
- Building the *image-model.dockerfile* :
```
docker build -t final-proj-model:resnet50-v2-001 -f image-model.dockerfile .
```
- Run the *image-model.dockerfile* :
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8500:8500 final-proj-model:resnet50-v2-001
```
### There are many ways to run the *gateway* service :

Terminal_2

#### 1 - Flask, gunicorn and virtual environment:
```
pip install pipenv
```
From the project's folder, run :
``` 
pipenv install
```
- All the dependencies should be automatically soddisfied, just verify.
- Run the local service using gunicorn inside the virtual environment:
```
pipenv run gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 gateway:app
```
Terminal_3 :
```
python test_local.py
```
Warning : the url of the image it is hardcoded in this script, if you want to eavluate another image please modify the script before to run it.

#### 2 - Run the Docker for the *gateway* service :
- Building the *image-gateway.dockerfile* :
```
docker build -t final-proj-gateway:001 -f image-gateway.dockerfile .
```
- Run the *image-gateway.dockerfile* :
```
docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 final-proj-gateway:001
```

#####################




There is also the file: *Dockerfile* in the repository, through this you can run the service in a completely separate container. To run the Docker, be sure your docker service is running. If you are using wsl2 on Windows, to run the build command you need to make sure your docker dekstop is running, otherwise you will get an error. 
For the docker, you have to:

- From the project directory, create the docker image :
```
docker build -t player_prediction .
```
- Run the docker image created:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 player_prediction:latest
```
The build command can take several minutes to run. Just give it time.

#### Test the local service:

- To test the local service, you can run the test script in another terminal:
```
python test.py
```
- If you e market:
```
vi test.py
```

#### Video of the service running :
I also attached the screenshot of the service running with flask and gunicorn.
