### The importance of a praecox pneumonia infection's diagnosis:

####
Pneumonia is an inflammation in your lungs caused by a bacterial, viral or fungal infection. It makes it difficult to breathe and can cause a fever and cough with yellow, green or bloody mucus. The flu, COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease are common causes of pneumonia. Treatment depends on the cause and severity of pneumonia.
Not surprisingly many consider that chest radiology, which is a relatively inexpensive test, plays a fundamental and important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia, together with clinical assessment and sometimes appropriate microbiological testing. Its primary purpose is to diagnose or exclude pneumonia.

####

### Neural Network and Deep Learning to build a binary classifier to elaborate x-ray images:
####
The target of this project is to create a service that automatically verify the presence of a pneumonia infection, using Deep Learning tools on the x-ray images of patient's chest.
On the base layer of a pretrained model I built a new top layer, that it is been trained to our scopes through a Neural Network.
The choosen pre-trained model it has been *ResNet50* from the *keras* package.
The initial weights for the preprocess of the images come from *imagenet*.
####
--- 
### Dataset:
####
The *dataset* used for training of the model come from *Keggle* and contains ~ 6000 x-ray images, splitted in *NORMAL* and *PNEUMONIA* classes.
Here you can find all the information about the dataset :
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia]
####

### Software architecture :
I decided to develop two services, once for each main function:

#### Service 1 - *Gateway*:
This function load the input image from an URL provided from the user through the user interface, execute a specific preprocessing, and send this data trought the network to the *TF-Serving* service. At this point the *Gateway-service* wait to have the evaluation back from TF-Serving to execute a post elaboration to present the data back to the user.
#### Service 2 - TF-Serving: 
This function input it is a preprocessed image, and it is designed to apply inference on this data, using the model that we trained for this scope. 
TF-Service use a lot of GPU resources to evaluate the image, and this is one of the main reason behind the choice to split the application in two different services. 
The *model* is applied on the preprocessed image coming from the *gateway-service*, and *TF-Serving* send back to that service the results of the elaboration.

```

### Repository content:
#### - notebook.ipynb file
This repository contains *notebook.ipynb file* : In this file we load the *ResNet50* model and the *dataset* downloaded from kaggle.
We worked on the *model* building on its top our specific *dense layer / inner layer* trained on the images loaded from our *dataset*.     
In the same file we tried different setup to obtain the best performance, tuning model parameters, as : *leraning_rate*, *drop_rate* and *augmentation*.
#### - ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5 file
We used the *keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint()* function to export the most performing model into the file: *ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5*.
#### - chest_xray-model folder
This is our final model format, we obtain it as output of method *tf_saved_model.save()*, applied to our *ResNet50_v2_12_0.950.h5* ; in this format it is compatible with *TF-Serving* service.
#### - image-model-dockerfile
This is the *docker* that we buil to apply the model.
We decided to have two separated services, one specialized in model application *model*, and another one that collect the requests from the client and provide to data elaboration pre and post evaluation *gateway*.
#### - tf-serving-connect.ipynb
Through this notebook we implemented the *gateway* service that provide image's pre-elaboration and send it to *image-model-dockerfile* that it is running to evaluate the x-ray chest images submitted.
#### - gateway.py
this is the convertion of the notebook *tf-serving-connect.ipynb* in a python script.
#### - Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
These files specify the dependencies that *gateway.py* script needs to install running in a virtual environment.
#### - proto.py
In this file we included the method *np_to_protobuf()*, this is the only method thatvwe need from *tensorflow* library.
In this way we can avoid to include in the project the huge *tensorflow* library (1.7Gb).
#### - image-gateway.dockerfile
This is the file to build the *docker* for the *gateway service*. We use this *dockerfile* to specify its parameters.
#### - test.py
This script provide the access at the diagnostic service, it loads the image url from the *user_terminal* and send it to the *gateway-service* receving back the image evaluation.
#### - docker-compose.yaml
This configuration file it is used to put the two docker in the same network and test the services using the *docker-compose* function.
#### - kube-config folder
This folder contains the *kuberenetes* configuration file that we will use in section_3.
#### - model-deployment.yaml
Configuration file for the model deployment.
#### - model-service.yaml
Configuration file for the model service.
#### - gateway-deployment.yaml
Configuration file for the gateway deployment.
#### - gateway-service.yaml
Configuration file for the gateway service.
#### - test_kuberenetes.py
Script to test our services deployed in a local kuberenetes
